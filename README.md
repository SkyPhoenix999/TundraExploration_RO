# TundraExploration_RO
Realism Overhaul Configuration Files for the TundraExploration, TundraTechnologies, and KerbalReusabilityExpansion Mods.

Works with KSP 1.12 and TundraExploration Version 7.0

TundraExploration and its dependencies can be found here: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/166915-112x-tundra-exploration-v70-nov-5th-2023-restockalike-spacex-falcon-9-crew-dragon-xl-haven-1/

ConformalDecals is Required to use the flag textures in the KSP Flags Folder

These configs are a work in progress, do not expect them to work 100% just yet.

The RO_TE_Plumes file is largely made by Nessus, who made the original TundraExploration RO Configs
